# Stellite Zeronet/IPFS integration alpha testing

We've reached a stage where we'd like to start testing the ZeroNet
and IPFS integration with a wider test group.

The integration fetches the seed list from ZeroNet and IPFS when the daemon is
started. The daemon runs as a full IPFS node as well, it is compatible
with the standard IPFS tools meaning you can interact with IPFS whenever
your Stellite daemon is running.

## First test

The first test only requires you to download and run the precompiled daemons. You'll
